A modern MP3 tagger with Discogs integration — built as a replacement for Tag&Rename, fixing its UTF-8/special character encoding bug when fetching metadata from Discogs.

## Features

### Explorer & File List
- Special folder shortcuts (Musik, Downloads, Desktop, Dokumente, Videos) above the tree
- Full folder tree — single click expands, double click scans MP3s
- Files sorted by album → track number (natural sort)
- Cover column (♪) indicates embedded covers; click a file to preview its cover
- Dual cover panel: **folder.jpg** left, **tag cover** right
- "folder.jpg als Tag-Cover setzen" button — appears when folder.jpg exists but tag cover is missing

### Discogs Search
- Search by Artist + Album — returns both **releases and Master releases** (★ gold)
- Single click on result loads track count, total duration and cover status instantly
- Client-side album title filter — no false positives from track title matches
- Detail cache — no double-download when browsing results

### TrackMatch Dialog
- Local filenames and Discogs tracklist shown side by side
- ▲/▼ moves **files OR Discogs tracks independently** — click the column to choose side
- `Datei nicht gefunden!` in red when Discogs has more tracks than local files
- **Compilation auto-detection** — per-track artists from Discogs API → `Title /// Artist` format → splits title/artist, sets Album Artist = "Various Artists"
- **Master releases** automatically load their main release for full label/country data
- **Drag & drop cover** from browser directly into the cover field
- **Google Images search** button opens browser pre-filled with artist/album/year

### BPM Calculation
- **♩ BPM** button calculates beats per minute via librosa beat detection
- Runs in background thread — UI stays responsive
- Loads max 60 seconds per file for speed (sufficient for accurate detection)
- Skips files that already have a BPM tag

### Configurable File Table
- Columns **Album Artist** and **BPM** shown by default
- Optional columns (hidden by default): Bitrate, Kommentar, Label, Disc#
- **Right-click any column header** to show/hide columns
- **Drag & drop** columns to reorder — layout persists across sessions

### Tag Writing
- Correct UTF-8 encoding via mutagen (fixes the Ö/Ü/Ä and Cyrillic bug in Tag&Rename)
- Corrupt APIC frames fully replaced, not stacked
- **Album Artist (TPE2)** always written alongside Artist
- Cover resized to max 600×600 px via Pillow
- `folder.jpg` written to album folder alongside tags

### Cover Quality Scanner
- Scans folder tree recursively, checks every embedded cover via full Pillow decode
- Categories: 🔴 Corrupt · 🟡 Too small (<300px) · ⚪ No cover
- Activated as soon as any folder is selected in the tree — uses selected folder as root
- Double-click any result to load that album directly in the tagger

### File Renaming
- Mask-based renaming with persistent custom masks (save/delete per mask)
- **Absolute path masks** — `I:\Musik\%1\[%4] %3\%6-%2` moves files to any drive/folder
- Before renaming: extracts cover from first MP3 tag and saves as `folder.jpg` if none exists
- `folder.jpg` copied to all destination folders when files are moved

### Background Scanning
- Folder scan runs in background thread — UI stays fully responsive
- Cancel button (✕) visible during scan
- Scan ID mechanism — stale results from cancelled scans are discarded
